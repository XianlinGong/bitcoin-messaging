What is the Bitcoin Messaging System?
-------------------------------------

The Bitcoin Messaging System is a proof-of-concept of a pseudonymous and decentralized messaging
system based on the virtual currency Bitcoin. Messages are embedded into 
regular Bitcoin transactions, distributed over Bitcoin's underlying P2P network
and stored in the transaction ledger, the blockchain.
